Two types of lycanthropes exist in the Iliac Bay area - werewolves and wereboars, out of the eight total recorded species of tamriel.

AncientLichAdvice,"Due to the extreme danger of the Ancient Lich's spellcasting abilities, the use of Spell Reflection, Spell Resistance, or Spell Absorption is a definite must when fighting one.

When fighting a Daedra Lord, close in quickly to prevent him from using magic too frequently, and backpedal after striking to avoid his attacks.

LichSummary,"Liches were powerful mages in life and achieved undeath of their own accord. They have retained their intellect - including their spellcasting abilities - while becoming much more physically powerful at the same time. As such, a lich is a dangerous adversary for even the most seasoned adventurers—provided they don't first annihilate themselves with their own magic, which they frequently do."
LichAdvice,"The use of Spell Reflection, Spell Resistance, or Spell Absorption is a definite must; a lich can easily kill you if you aren't prepared.

VampireAncientSummary,"The Vampire Ancient (sometimes styled as Ancient Vampire) is possibly the most dangerous foe one will encounter. Unlike Ancient Liches and Daedra Lords, they appear very frequently at higher levels and have no ranged spells - therefore, they can't blast themselves into Oblivion with their own attacks."
VampireAncientAdvice,"Spell Reflection is a life saver, but Shock or Spell Resistance are of great use. Having healing spells at the ready is also recommended, provided you have the chance to use them. Ranged weapons are almost useless, since Vampire Ancients are very fast and can be within melee range before you have reloaded your weapon. Spell Absorption is little help, unless you have a lot of empty Magicka which can be restored by the Ancient's Shock spells, and these attacks are quite powerful. Characters with a capacity of at most 50 Magicka will probably not be able to absorb even a single Shock spell before it causes damage. On the other hand, if you have a powerful Spell Reflection spell, the Vampire Ancient will kill itself easily with its own Shock attacks. And although they are immune to paralysis, they can be paralyzed if their own spells are reflected back at them."

WraithSummary,"Like ghosts, wraiths are the spirits of the dead, but are much more powerful than their counterparts - both in melee and with magic."
