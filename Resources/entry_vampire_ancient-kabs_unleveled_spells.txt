Vampire Ancient
Summary:*The Vampire Ancient (sometimes styled as Ancient Vampire) is possibly the most dangerous foe one will encounter. Unlike Ancient Liches and Daedra Lords, they appear very frequently at higher levels and have no ranged spells - therefore, they can't blast themselves into Oblivion with their own attacks. The Vampire Ancient (sometimes styled Ancient Vampire) is possibly the most dangerous foe in the game. Unlike Ancient Liches and Daedra Lords, they appear very frequently at higher levels and have no ranged spellsâ€”therefore, they can't blast themselves into Oblivion with their own attacks. They can be hit by weapons of mithril quality or higher.
Advice:*Spell Reflection is a life saver, but Shock or Spell Resistance are of great use. Having healing spells at the ready is also recommended, provided you have the chance to use them. Ranged weapons are almost useless, since Vampire Ancients are very fast and can be within melee range before you have reloaded your weapon. Spell Absorption is little help, unless you have a lot of empty Magicka which can be restored by the Ancient's Shock spells, and these attacks are quite powerful. Characters with a capacity of at most 50 Magicka will probably not be able to absorb even a single Shock spell before it causes damage. On the other hand, if you have a powerful Spell Reflection spell, the Vampire Ancient will kill itself easily with its own Shock attacks. And although they are immune to paralysis, they can be paralyzed if their own spells are reflected back at them.
