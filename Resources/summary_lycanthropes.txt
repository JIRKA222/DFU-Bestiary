Summary - Lycanthropes
Overview:*Lycanthropes are mortals who have been affected by Lycanthropy, a condition that transforms them into a large hybrid of humanoid and animal. Two types of lycanthropes exist in the Iliac Bay area - werewolves and wereboars, out of the eight total recorded species of tamriel. Weapons of at least silver quality are needed to harm them, though they're not exceptionally dangerous and carry no treasure. However, there is always a risk of contracting lycanthropy from combat.
