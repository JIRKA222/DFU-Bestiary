Summary - Atronachs
Overview:*Some of the atronachs in the Iliac Bay are Daedric in origin, however, some are golem-like constructs created by mages in the Iliac Bay. Though they can be hit by any material, they are tied to a certain element and are thus weak to the opposing element. Lastly, they carry no treasure.
