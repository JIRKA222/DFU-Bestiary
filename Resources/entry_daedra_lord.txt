Daedra Lord
Summary:*With weapons and magic at their disposal, Daedra Lords are powerful and dangerous opponents. They can only be hit by weapons of mithril quality or higher.
Advice:*One of the most dangerous foes in the game, the Daedra Lord possesses formidable fighting abilities in close combat. When fighting a Daedra Lord, close in quickly to prevent him from using magic too frequently, and backpedal after striking to avoid his attacks. Spell Reflection, Spell Resistance, or Spell Absorption is a must, especially when fighting at distance as he will use his area effect Fireball spell. A Daedra Lord will sometimes use this spell too close, resulting in his own harm or destruction from its blast. The Daedric language skill can sometimes render an enemy non-hostile.
