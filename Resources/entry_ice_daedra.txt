Ice or Frost Daedra
Summary:*Frost Daedra are wreathed in the cold mists of Oblivion. Not only do their warhammers pack a devastating punch, but Frost Daedra can cast cold-based spells. They can only be hit by weapons of mithril quality or higher.
Advice:*Close in quickly and use melee attacks to deny the Frost Daedra an opportunity to cast its ranged spells. You may also wish to protect yourself with Spell Reflection, Spell Resistance, or Spell Absorption, or attack with fire-based offensive spells. The Daedric language skill can sometimes render an enemy non-hostile.
Abilities:*Can detect camouflaged or invisible foes
Spells:*Ice Bolt
 *Ice Storm
