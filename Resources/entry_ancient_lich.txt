Ancient Lich
Summary:*Ancient Liches are undead beings of immense power; stronger, smarter, faster, and tougher to destroy than their lesser brethren. They are one of the most dangerous opponents any adventurer will ever face.
Advice:*Due to the extreme danger of the Ancient Lich's spellcasting abilities, the use of Spell Reflection, Spell Resistance, or Spell Absorption is a definite must when fighting one. Your safest bets are to attack with ranged weapons or have plenty of healing potions and spells on hand. Ancient Liches will sometimes use area affect damage spells at too close a range and harm or even destroy themselves.
