Sabertooth Tiger
Location: *Oblivion lol
History: *Little is commonly known about the fire daedra and its brethren. They seem to be most commonly used by their masters, the Daedra Princes of Oblivion, as agents of destruction in itsleast subtle form.
BBC: *A Scottish scientist has discovered that a 50,000-year-old bone found in Canada belonged to a sabretooth cat. The bone was among a number discovered in permafrost in Yukon and was thought to be from ancient cave lions. But DNA analysis by Inverness palaeogeneticist Dr Ross Barnett identified it as being a bone of an Ice Age scimitar-toothed cat. He was sent the bones while in Copenhagen on a fellowship looking at the genomics of ancient lions.
